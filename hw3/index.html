		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>

		<h3>Ray Generation and Primitive Intersections</h3>
		For ray generation, we first converted the given normalised image coordinates (x, y) into camera space. The virtual sensor was defined on the z = -1 plane, and we mapped 
		(x, y) to a point on the sensor using the field of view (FOV). The bottom-left and top-right 
		corners of the sensor were computed using:</p>
		
		<pre>
		left = -tan(hFov / 2), right = tan(hFov / 2)
		bottom = -tan(vFov / 2), top = tan(vFov / 2)
		</pre>
		
		<p>Using these values, we calculated the corresponding point on the sensor as:</p>
		
		<pre>
		sensor_x = left + (right - left) * x
		sensor_y = bottom + (top - bottom) * y
		</pre>
		<p>We then created a ray starting from the camera origin (0,0,0) and passing through this 
		calculated sensor point. The direction was initially set in camera space, then transformed 
		to world space using the camera-to-world transformation matrix <code>c2w</code> provided. Finally, we normalised 
		the direction vector and set the ray's near and far clipping distances to <code>nclip</code> and <code>fclip</code>.</p>
		
		<p>For triangle-ray intersections, we implemented a variation of the Möller-Trumbore algorithm. We first defined the edges of the triangle:
		
		<pre>
		edge1 = v1 - v0
		edge2 = v2 - v0
		</pre>
		
		<p>Then, we calculated the determinant using the cross product:</p>
		
		<pre>
		h = cross(ray.dir, edge2)
		det = dot(edge1, h)
		</pre>
		
		<p>If the determinant was close to zero, the ray was parallel to the triangle, and so we ignored it.</p>
		
		<p>We then calculated barycentric coordinates to determine if the intersection point was inside the triangle:</p>
		
		<pre>
		f = 1.0 / det
		s = ray.origin - v0
		u = f * dot(s, h)
		</pre>
		
		<p>If u was not between 0 and 1, we discarded the intersection. We did something similar for v:</p>
		
		<pre>
		q = cross(s, edge1)
		v = f * dot(ray.dir, q)
		</pre>
		
		<p>If v was out of range or if u + v exceeded 1, then the intersection was outside the triangle.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, we computed t (the intersection distance along the ray):</p>
		
		<pre>
		t = f * dot(edge2, q)
		</pre>
		
		<p>If t was within the valid range (between <code>min_t</code> and <code>max_t</code> of the ray), we updated <code>max_t</code> to 
		this new intersection distance and stored the intersection details, including the interpolated normal 
		using barycentric coordinates.</p>

		<h3>Triangle Intersection</h3>
		<p>We first implemented <code>has_intersection</code>, a function that checked if a ray intersected the triangle without actually recording the details of the intersection. To implement this function, we did the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First, we got the ray’s origin and direction.</li>
			<li>Then, we defined the triangle edges and calculated the normal vector using the cross product.</li>
			<li>We computed the intersection of the ray with the triangle’s plane and checked if it was within valid bounds.</li>
			<li>Using barycentric coordinates, we verified if the intersection point lay inside the triangle. If it did, we returned <code>true</code> and updated the ray’s <code>max_t</code>.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>The <code>intersect</code> function was similar to <code>has_intersection</code>, but it also recorded the intersection data when an intersection happened.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First, we called <code>has_intersection</code> to check if the ray intersected the triangle at all. If not, we could immediately return <code>false</code>.</li>
			<li>We set up the ray’s origin, direction, and triangle’s edges again.</li>
			<li>Using the <code>max_t</code> from <code>has_intersection</code>, we computed the exact intersection point.</li>
			<li>We used barycentric coordinates to calculate the normal at the intersection point.</li>
			<li>Then, we stored the intersection details, including the intersection distance, normal, and material properties.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here are some images with normal shading:</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		<p>For Part 2 of this homework, we implemented a BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) construction algorithm to optimise and speed up ray-triangle intersection queries in our renderer.</p>
	
		<p>We began by calculating the bounding box for the entire set of primitives within the range <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>. 
		We iterated through the primitives, expanding the bounding box <code>bbox</code> to surround all of them. This bounding box would be the enclosing volume for the BVH node. 
		
		<p>Next, we checked if the number of primitives in the current node was less than or equal to <code>max_leaf_size</code>. If it was, it was a leaf node, and we set the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> iterators for the node, which we would later point to the range of primitives stored in that leaf. If the node contained more than <code>max_leaf_size</code> primitives, we had to split it into two child nodes. 
		To decide how to split, we calculated the extent of the bounding box along each of the three axes (x, y, and z). We chose the axis with the largest extent to split along, as this would likely give us the best spatial separation between the two groups of primitives.</p>
		
		<p>After choosing the axis, we needed to split the primitives based on their centroids along the selected axis. We used <code>std::sort</code> to sort the primitives based on their centroids along the selected axis. This meant that we could divide the primitives roughly into 2 equal halves.
		Finally, we recursively called <code>construct_bvh</code> to construct the left and right child nodes. We passed the <code>start</code> and <code>split</code> iterators for the left child and <code>split</code> and <code>end</code> iterators for the right child.</p>
		
		<p>We decided to split the primitives along the axis (x, y, or z) with the biggest size because it helps create a larger gap between the two child nodes. This makes it easier for the BVH to quickly reject nodes during ray tracing tests because there’s less overlap between the child nodes. 
		Essentially, splitting along the largest axis allows for better separation, which improves efficiency when checking for intersections.</p>
	
		<p>Here are some large .dae files with normal shading that can only be rendered with BVH acceleration:</p>
