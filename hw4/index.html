		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		
		<p>Here are some screenshots of <code>scene/pinned2.json</code> from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe, showing the structure of our point masses and springs .</p>

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		We experimented with altering certain parameters and observed the effects of these on our rendered cloth.
		
		<h4>ks (spring constant)</h4>
		<p>Low ks: less structural integrity in the fabric, kept vibrating, seemed less stiff and thinner.</p>
		<p>High ks: much stiffer fabric, wasn't as loose, didn't drape as much at the top and felt thicker.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2/low_ks.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption><code>ks = 5</code></figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task2/high_ks.png" width="400px"/>
					<figcaption><code>ks = 50000</code></figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h4>Density</h4>
		<p>Low density: less heavy and the fabric came to a still point very quickly.</p>
		<p>High density: more weighted and the cloth kept vibrating and moving for a long time.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2/low_density.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption><code>density = 1</code></figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task2/high_density.png" width="400px"/>
					<figcaption><code>density = 100000</code></figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h4>Damping</h4>
		<p>Low damping: fell very quickly, swung around, cloth wasn't stable and swayed a lot even at the resting phase.</p>
		<p>High damping: High damping: very controlled and prolonged fall, almost felt like the cloth was slowly trying to go through a viscous, syrupy substance. It moved very slowly but also came to a still state much sooner.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task2/low_damping.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption><code>damping = 0.000%</code></figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

					<figcaption><code>damping = 1.000%</code></figcaption>

			  </tr>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>
		  In <code>Sphere::collide</code>, we calculated the vector from the sphere's center to the point mass. If the length of that vector was less than the sphere's radius, that meant that the point mass was inside the sphere.
		  Then we calculated the point on the surface of the sphere (the "tangent point") where the point mass should have landed with a small offset so the cloth wouldn't get stuck. To move the point mass there, we calculated a correction vector and scaled it by <code>(1 - friction)</code> before updating its position.</p>
		  
		<p>For <code>Plane::collide</code>, we checked if a point mass crossed from one side of the plane to the other between time steps. If it did, we found where it would have intersected the plane (again with a small offset above the surface) and then used a similar correction vector with friction.</p>
		 
		<p>Here is our implementation with three different spring constant (ks) values:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task3/ks_500.png" width="330px"/>
				  <figcaption><code>ks = 500</code>. The cloth was really stretchy and sagged a lot over the sphere.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task3/ks_5000.png" width="330px"/>
					<figcaption><code>ks = 5000</code>. The cloth draped naturally over the sphere but also seemed to keep its own structure.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task3/ks_50000.png" width="330px"/>
					<figcaption><code>ks = 50000</code>. The cloth was too stiff and barely bent around the sphere. It looked kind of floaty and unnatural.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>Here is a screenshot of the cloth lying at rest on the plane:</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		To handle self-collisions, we added logic to detect and respond to collisions between point masses within the same cloth. We wanted to avoid expensive all-pairs checks by hashing point masses into a grid, as described in the spec. For each point mass, we looked up nearby point masses in adjacent spatial bins and then used repulsion forces to prevent intersections.
		<p>We divided the simulation space into 3D bins using a hash function and assigned each point mass to a bin based on its position. We built the hash map, then for each point mass we got its neighbors within nearby bins and used a correction vector to separate intersecting masses. We scaled this vector by friction and distance to mimic realistic behaviour. This meant that the cloth was able to fold over itself naturally without tunneling or sticking.
		</p>

		<p>Here are some images that document how the cloth fell and folded on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4/part1/4_1.png" width="330px"/>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task4/part1/4_2.png" width="330px"/>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task4/part1/4_3.png" width="330px"/>
					<!-- <figcaption><code>ks = 50000</code>. The cloth was too stiff and barely bent around the sphere. It looked kind of floaty and unnatural.</figcaption> -->
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<div>
			<table> 
				<tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4/part1/4_4.png" width="330px"/>
				  <!-- <figcaption><code>ks = 500</code>. The cloth was really stretchy and sagged a lot over the sphere.</figcaption> -->
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task4/part1/4_5.png" width="330px"/>
					<!-- <figcaption><code>ks = 5000</code>. The cloth draped naturally over the sphere but also seemed to keep its own structure.</figcaption> -->
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>We also varied the density and ks, and observed the following:</p>

		<h4>Density</h4>
		<p>Low density: the cloth folded more smoothly into clear lines horizontally rather than lots of teeny folds making up each larger one. It also had more folds across the entire cloth at the beginning of the fall.</p>
		<p>High density: more folds as the cloth folded and landed on itself. It looked more textural, crinkled and “crunchy?” Looked like mountainous mini-folds within each larger fold, and the folds were very localised at the beginning of the fall, only at the bottom of the cloth rather than across the entire piece of fabric.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4/part2/d_1_1.png" width="400px"/>

				<td style="text-align: center;">

				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4/part2/d_1500_1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption><code>density = 1500</code></figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="task4/part2/d_1500_2.png" width="400px"/>
					<figcaption><code>density = 1500</code></figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		


		<h4>ks (spring constant)</h4>
		<p>Low ks: the cloth had lots of teeny folds that were more crinkled. As it came to a state of rest, the cloth looked shapeless and like a spiky blob on the plane rather than an obvious folded piece of fabric. The spring constant being low meant that the original square shape of the fabric wasn't well-retained.</p>
		<p>High ks: the fabric creates fewer but larger, flatter folds that retain shape well so that the cloth reaches a flat, rectangular state at rest.</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		A shader program is code that runs on the GPU to make rendering faster and more aesthetically pleasing. It has two parts: the vertex shader (which moves vertices and passes info like normals/UVs) and the fragment shader (which colours each pixel using lighting and materials). The vertex shader runs once for each vertex in a mesh. It takes in data like the vertex’s position, normal, and texture coordinates, and applies transformations (like camera view and projection) to move it to the correct spot on screen. It can also pass along "varying" variables, like the transformed normal or UV coordinates, to the next stage. The fragment shader runs for every pixel (or fragment) inside the triangle made by the vertices. It takes the interpolated values from the vertex shader (like normals or UVs) and uses them to compute the final color of each pixel, based on lighting models, textures, bump maps, etc. Together, they simulate how materials react to light — shiny, matte, bumpy, smooth, etc. which help simulate specific materials.
